 <p> <h3>The Punjab government has rolled back its decision to increase court fees, offering relief to the public. On Saturday, a new notification was issued, reducing the fees following approval from the provincial governor.<br>
    The court fee, which had been raised significantly, was brought down from Rs. 500 to just Rs. 10. Earlier, under the Punjab Finance Act 2024, the government had increased court fees and stamp duties by a large margin.
